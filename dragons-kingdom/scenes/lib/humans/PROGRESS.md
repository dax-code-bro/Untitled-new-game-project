# Humans - progress log (for a successor)

## State (2026-10-07, session 2, ~02:30 UTC)

Done (code committed; caches are git-ignored and rebuilt with offline/build.py)
- Offline library committed (was git-ignored as `build/` by the repo-root .gitignore; now `offline/`).
- Garments: drape envelope + bridged/smoothed hull (no anatomy under cloth), undergarment
  collider, sleeves as tapering tubes, cuffs gathered (sleeve stacking), belts / laced waists
  cinch wider cloth (gathers), V-necklines, band collars, clean openings, irregular skirt flutes,
  riding coats with front opening + back vent, hero cloth subdivision, self-collision on upper
  garments, pole relaxing (no puckers at the mesh poles), coif/cap gathers, kerchief tails.
- Riders: built in a seated dress pose (legs astride), skirts start flat and fall onto the thighs
  and a rising saddle collider; no ground plane at pelvis height (that bug held skirts up).
- Hands: real cylinder grips (every finger segment closes onto the object surface).
- Face: lid-margin / flush / under-eye / upper-lid masks (aux2), caruncles, eyelashes follow the
  blink morphs, cornea-only strong clearcoat, warm eye fill, iris desaturation, skin speckle.
- Hair: pulled-back flow over the crown, baby hairs at the hairline, scalp coverage from the
  strands (limited to above the hairline), hair kept under caps/coifs/hoods, soft alpha edges,
  tinted Kajiya-Kay highlights.
- Props: leather/wood/iron use only the scan's luminance variation when a colour is given.
- Cast: 48 ids (offline/characters.py), incl. 18-villager crowd kit, riders, Abby states.
- Runtime API: index.js (loadCharacter, placeCharacter, joinHands, setDust, rider + person adapters).
- Look-dev: humans-contact.js (7 sheets, turntable by frac(t)), humans-hero.js (8 hero shots),
  humans-riders.js (riders mounted on Leaf / Charcoal with the creature library), humans-dev.js.

In flight / next
- Full rebuild of every character with the latest code (2-3 parallel processes, ~1.5 h).
- Contact sheets + hero angles at preview, fix what shows, then final 4K + 1:1 crops.
- npm test, README numbers, report with image paths.
